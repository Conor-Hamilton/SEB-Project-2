# Game of Thrones Character App

## Description:

This was a partnered hack-a-thon style project, focusing on React.js and integrating public APIs. The main goal was to create an interactive web application and which allows users to explore characters from the "Game of Thrones" series, view detailed information about each character, and even assemble a team to "defeat the White Walkers". The application showcases my skills in React, API integration, and responsive design.

## Install Instructions:

1. Close repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run dev` - This should then open a localhost page in your browser

## Timeframe & Working Team:

This project was developed under an intense timeframe of less than 48 hours, in partnership with Florent Giovannone. Our approach to teamwork was dynamic and collaborative; we conducted regular meetings every one to two hours to discuss our progress, challenges, and next steps. Each meeting concluded with a clear set of deliverables for each of us to focus on before reconvening. This method ensured continuous communication and integration of our work, allowing us to efficiently divide and conquer the project tasks. We utilized Git for version control, pushing our individual contributions to the shared repository and merging them regularly to keep our project in sync.

## Technologies Used:

- Front End: React.js for building the user interface, React Router for navigation.
- Styling: Bulma for the CSS framework, with some custom SCSS for additional styling.
- API: public Game of Thrones API for fetching character data.
- Developement tools: Git for version control and GitHub for the repository.

## Brief:

The objective of this project was to solidify our understanding of React.js and API integration by creating a web application, reflecting the skills learned in the preceding week. The challenge was to demonstrate effective use of React's components and state management alongside fetching and displaying data from an external API.

## Planning:

- **Wireframing/Sketches:** We created initial sketches to outline the layouts for our MVP, ensuring a clear visual direction from the start.

- **Pseudo code:** Referencing the image provided, we drafted foundational pseudo code to structure our approach and facilitate task allocation.

- **Task Allocation:** Florent and I aimed for an industry-standard approach, adopting short sprints to distribute tasks while ensuring regular check-ins to balance the workload efficiently.
